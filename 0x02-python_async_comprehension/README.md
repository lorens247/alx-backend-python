# 0x02 - Async Comprehension in Python

This repository contains the code and examples related to asynchronous comprehension in Python. Specifically, it focuses on:

1. Writing asynchronous generators.
2. Utilizing async comprehensions.
3. Type-annotating generators for better clarity and readability.

## Contents

- **`async_comprehension.py`**: Contains examples and demonstrations of async comprehension usage.
- **`async_generator.py`**: Illustrates the implementation of asynchronous generators.
- **`type_annotations.py`**: Demonstrates how to type-annotate asynchronous generators for improved code understanding.
