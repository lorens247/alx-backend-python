# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## Introduction
This project explores the concepts of unit tests and integration tests, essential components of software testing methodologies. It covers the difference between unit and integration tests and common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations, and fixtures.

## Unit Tests vs. Integration Tests
Unit tests and integration tests serve different purposes in software testing:

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual units or components of the software in isolation, typically at the function or class level. They verify that each unit behaves as expected.

- **Integration Tests:** Test how multiple units or components interact with each other and with external dependencies. They verify that different parts of the system work together correctly.

## Common Testing Patterns
### Mocking
Mocking is a technique used to replace parts of the system with mock objects during testing. Mock objects simulate the behavior of real objects, allowing developers to isolate the unit being tested and control its dependencies.

### Parametrizations
Parametrization is a technique used to run the same test case with different input values or configurations. It helps test multiple scenarios efficiently without writing duplicate test code.

### Fixtures
Fixtures are reusable setup and teardown functions used in test cases. They help prepare the testing environment, such as creating test data or setting up resources, before executing test cases. Fixtures ensure that tests are executed in a consistent state.

## Conclusion
Unit tests and integration tests are essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of software systems. By understanding the differences between these types of tests and common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations, and fixtures, developers can write effective test cases to validate their code and catch potential issues early in the development process.
